I dragged and dropped files from a java project into github. You probably wont understand all the code because you do not have the question 
form of the project or the forms from the project. However these files can give you an idea of some of the challenges and 
content I encountered at Computer Power Plus. Note also that some of the code was auto generated by the IDE.
