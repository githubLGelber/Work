I dragged and dropped some sample files from a java project and a C# project into github. These files do not constitute a complete project and you probably wont understand all the code because you do not have the question 
form of the projects or the forms from the project (and not all files are included). However these files can give you an idea of some of the challenges and 
content I encountered at Computer Power Plus. Note also that some of the code was auto generated by the IDE.
